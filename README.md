## Description
The motivation for this project was to build a back-end application that would allow you to hold employee information. create new employees, change their roles, plus more! I built this application to practice mySQL and learn more about how databases work. This problem allows a manager to update their staff and add new members to their companies database. 


## Usage
To use this application the user will start it, then select which action they would like to see- depending on what they choose the user will then be asked a series of questions pertaining to the action they chose. Once the user has completed all questions, the employee information will be updated and changed within the database. When the user wants to quit using the application they press the "quit" button and the application will stop.
